## Project Overview
### Introduction:
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often colloquially referred to as Obamacare, stands as one of the most significant pieces of healthcare legislation in the United States in recent history. Enacted in March 2010 under the administration of President Barack Obama, the ACA aimed to address longstanding issues within the American healthcare system, including access, affordability, and quality of care. The period from 2010 to 2016 in the United States marked a significant chapter in healthcare. My project, "US Health Insurance Coverage Analysis (2010-2016)," dives into this era to uncover trends and impacts on coverage.

Through this data analysis, we aim to shed light on changes in uninsured rates, Medicaid enrollment, Medicare enrollment, marketplace exchanges, and employer-sponsored insurance. By understanding these trends, we hope to inform policymaking and contribute to ongoing efforts to improve healthcare access for all Americans. Join us as we draw insights from this popular health insurance coverage as we work towards a more equitable healthcare system.

### Objectives:
To conduct a comprehensive analysis of healthcare coverage metrics from 2010 to 2016, focusing on the top-performing states in various categories:
- Top States with the Most Declined Uninsured Rate (2010-2016): Identify and analyze the states that experienced the most significant reduction in uninsured rates over the six-year period. Investigate factors contributing to the decline in uninsured rates, such as Medicaid expansion, marketplace enrollment, and outreach initiatives.

- State Medicaid Expansion Enrollment Status (2016): Assess the Medicaid expansion status of states in 2016 and examine the impact of expansion on healthcare coverage and access.
Compare enrollment rates and healthcare outcomes between states that expanded Medicaid and those that did not.

- States with the Most Significant Medicaid Enrollment Change (2013-2016): Identify states with the largest changes in Medicaid enrollment from 2013 to 2016, including both increases and decreases. Explore factors driving changes in Medicaid enrollment, such as economic conditions, demographic shifts, and policy changes.

- States with the most significant Health Insurance Coverage Change (2010-2015): Analyze states with the most notable changes in health insurance coverage from 2010 to 2015, considering shifts in employer-sponsored coverage, Medicaid expansion, and marketplace enrollment. Examine variations in coverage change patterns across states and demographic groups.

- States by Average Monthly Credit (2016): Identify states where individuals received the highest average monthly tax credits for marketplace health insurance coverage in 2016.
Evaluate the effectiveness of tax credits in making health insurance coverage more affordable for residents.

- States by Marketplace Tax Credits (2016): Analyze states where individuals received the highest total amount of marketplace tax credits in 2016. Assess the distribution of tax credits across states and their impact on marketplace enrollment and affordability.

- States by Employee Health Insurance Coverage (2015), Marketplace Health Insurance Coverage (2016), Medicaid Enrollment (2016), and Medicare Enrollment (2016): Compare states based on levels of employee-sponsored health insurance coverage, marketplace enrollment, Medicaid enrollment, and Medicare enrollment. Examine variations in coverage sources and enrollment rates across states.

- Uninsured Rate Change By States (2010-2016): Create a geographic visualization of uninsured rate changes across states from 2010 to 2016. Highlight states with the most significant reductions or increases in uninsured rates and explore regional trends.
